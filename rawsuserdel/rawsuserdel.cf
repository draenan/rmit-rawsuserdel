# Alternatively, it can go anywhere provided the "-c" option

# Use variable = value.  Quotes optional.  Commented values represent

# min_uid -  Ignore requests to delete accounts with UIDs lower than this
#            value.  Note that nobody, nobody4, and noaccess users are left
#            alone regardless of this setting.  Also note that database
#            tables with prefixes that match the usernames of protected UIDs
#            will still be dropped; this should not be a problem as protected
#            UIDs should not have RAWS blogs.
